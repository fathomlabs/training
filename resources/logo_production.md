# Logo production

Some tips on the process and pricing, mostly from [this post](http://thenuschool.com/price-logo-design/)

## 1. Creating design brief

- Main tasks
  - manage client expectations - they may not appreciate the difference between poorly/well-designed logo
    - who will own the work? Will you sign over everything to the client for unlimited use, or licence the product for limited time/uses?
  - understand what the client wants
- Sub tasks
  - create a questionnaire to find out
    - what is the purpose of the logo and where will it be presented/used?
    - what exactly is the product/service that the business is providing?
    - what is the company's history?
    - when is the deadline for the logo to be provided?
    - who is the target audience?
    - who are the competitors?
    - are there any restrictions (e.g. PG-16 or NSFW)?
    - how many revisions are the client expecting to see before the final (1, 2, more?!)?
    - what formats/sizes are required (print/digital/web)?
    
We have a copy of [this](http://goo.gl/forms/Hneqy3kHoJNOHdhn2) google form in our drive which we can edit and send out to clients to answer these questions. This also hightlights to the client an idea of how much work is needed to create a logo.

## 2. Research

- is the business new or does it already have a style?
  - if it has an existing style, try to enhance rather than compromise (unless it is terrible/needs rebranding for a fresh start)
  - if it is a new business, try to understand their visions/dreams, the logo should epitomise these
- who are the clients of the business?
  - how do they interact with the business
  - what style does the business want to portray (playful/fun, friendly/approachable, professional, serious)?
- try to understand the culture
- don't expect to get direct answers to these things, need to work them out
- how unique/specific is the business?
  - who are the competitors?
  - logo must stand out
  - logo must fit in
  - find a range of logos from similar organisatons
    - rate them
    - think about how this one will fit in
  - ask client to send some logos they like

## 3. Creating the concept

- come up with a few different ideas and sketch
  - get feedback from someone you trust
  - get feedback from target audience (client's clients)
  - do not show to the client at this point
- take time out to browse logos, procrastinate, and gain inspriation
  - look at [this video](https://vimeo.com/113751583)

- where will it be used?
  - a square/hex/circle is fine for facebook etc but might not work so well in landscape

## 4. Presentation & revisions

- create a few polished pieces
  - provide different shapes/sizes
  - it is your job to explain what it means
  - it is your job to convince the client that it works - you are the expert and they want you to do the design thinking
- show the client in a meeting, or over email
  - depending on how happy they are, will move on to next revision (or final piece)
- this is the hard part, it is better to be a good designer and a great presenter than the other way around

## 5. Providing the logo

- check where (all the places) that the logo will be used
  - make different file types
  - make different resolutions
  - make different shapes
  - what colour background will it be on?
  - make colour and B&W versions
  - make inverted colour version
  - make transparent/opaque background versions
  - make favicon?

## Pricing

1. Creating the design brief [4 hours minimum]
  - may want to do this before making a firm agreement to do the work
  - should still price it in as it does take time
2. Research [8 hours minimum]
  - be strict: limit the time you spend on this as it could be much longer
3. Creating the concept [8 hours minimum]
  - be fair, you do not have to be 100% productive for this time, inspiration and procrastination are part of the process
4. Presentation & revisions [4 hours per revision minimum - so 8 hours minimum]
5. Providing the logo [4 hours minimum]
6. Management overheads [4 hours]
  - always add an extra charge for unforseen tasks (emails, meetings etc.)
